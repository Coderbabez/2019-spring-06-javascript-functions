##  Week Six - More Javascript

### Objectives
Update the Puppy Fun House page to responds to more event handlers and selectors.

### Vocab
* Javascript event handler
* JQuery
* Functions

### Review
* What do we use JavaScript for?
* How do we connect JavaScript to our html?
* What is an event handler?

### Lesson

Take a look at the [live site](http://coderbabez.github.io/2019-spring-06-javascript-functions):

* What are the html elements?
* What changes when the button is clicked?

Take a look at the html:

* What's in the html?
* How is the content initialized?
* How is the content changed when the button is clicked?

##### What are functions?

Functions are reusable sections of code. They are given 0, 1, or many parameters and operate on the page.

Functions look like:

```js
function functionName(parameter) {
  // code
}
```

Functions are called like:
```js
 functionName(value);
```

Don't worry too much about them now. Just know that you can call existing functions.

Find the functions in this project. Look in all the JavaScript files!

### Homework: Update this project

* Add a second button in the header that changes the body color of the page.
  * What function would you call to get a new color?
  * Align it to the right side of the page

* Add a 4th column
  * Have it update when the other 3 columns are updated
  * How are the columns being selected
  * How will the width of the columns change?
  * Can you create a new function that will update all 4 columns in 1 call?

* Update functions
  * Add 2 more dogs to the randomDog function
  * Add 2 more colors to the randomBodyColor function
